# SPACE WARS

Space Wars is a javascript arcade space-shooter made using the Phaser 3 Framework.


# Live version
Live version of the game [here](https://kwizl.github.io/space-shooter/)

## Overview
The goal of the game is to destroy as man enemies and asteroids as possible without getting killed. When the player shots an enemy they get 20 points on their score while shooting and asteroid is 5 points. You can control the spaceship is controlled by moving the arrow keys up, down, right and left to move as desired. To shot the lasers at the enmeies or asteroids press the keyboard key F.

## Design overview

The initial design for the game was meant to be a much more manuevering game while shooting. The movement of the player spaceship, enemy spaceship and the asteroids had to be restrained to the y-axis since having them move across the screen became would bring alot of complexity to the player experience.

### Obstacles
The obstacles that the player has to encounter are the enemy spaceships and the asteroids. The asteroids and the spaceships fall across the screen towards the player. The player has to destroy them by firing lasers or avoid getting hit by them. Initially the rocks were meant to be moving haphazardly across the screen. This proved to be too complicated and the time wasn't enough. I was able to implement the rocks to fall from the top of the screen.

### Future additions
Future additions may include addition of game levels with the player fighting the main enemy at the end of each level. There would also be a choice in the options scene for setting the level of defficulty for the game.
