## Overview

The goal of the game is to destroy as many enemies and asteroids as possible without getting killed. When the player shoots an enemy, they get 20 points on their score, while shooting an asteroid is 5 points. The spaceship is controlled by moving the arrow keys `up, down, right, and left` to move as desired. To shoot the lasers at the enemies or asteroids, press the keyboard `spacebar`.

## Design overview

The initial design for the game is a maneuvering game while shooting. The movement of the player spaceship, enemy spaceship, and the asteroids move along the y-axis since having them move across the screen in the x-axis brought about a lot of complexity to the player experience.

### Obstacles
The obstacles that the player has to encounter are the enemy spaceships and the asteroids. The asteroids and the spaceships fall across the screen towards the player. The player has to destroy them by firing lasers or avoid getting hit by them. Initially, the asteroids move haphazardly across the screen. Accomplishing this was difficult since time was not enough. However, I was able to make the asteroids to fall from the top of the screen.

### Future additions
Future additions may include the addition of game levels. There would also be a choice in the options scene for setting the level of difficulty for the game.
